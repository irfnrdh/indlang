# indlang
dynamic sign language design by me (@irfnrdh) to communicate to the world with simple term.  
I create that to be more "kode keras". I usually use this for common code communication.

This language basically separates a few things and add more layer pattern and sometimes  
make it hard to understand but it's easy to know it.

The main purpose of this language is to make it easy for everyone to use without having to learn it.
